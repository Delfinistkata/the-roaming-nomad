## Code Validation

### HTML

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) service was used to validate the HTML code of the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors.

As my project uses Jinja syntax, such as `{% for ... %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ ... }}`
it will not validate properly if I copy and paste into the HTML validator straight from my source files.

Usually in order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by url](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, nearly all of the pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated,
and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to the pages.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

### CSS

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) service was used to validate the CSS code of the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors. 

W3C CSS Validator found no errors or warnings on my CSS.

### Pyhton

Pylint was used continuously during the development process to analyze the Python code for programming errors.

[PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) was further used to validate the Python code to validate the Python code for PEP8 requirements. See below the validation results and the reviewed results.
